#### Preliminaries

WORKDIR /

# Create some directories.

# The telemetrygodev binary and related files live here.
RUN mkdir /app

#### Building binaries

# Set the working directory outside $GOPATH to ensure module mode is enabled.
WORKDIR /telemetry

# Copy go.mods and go.sums into the container.
# If they don't change, which is the common case, then docker can
# cache these COPYs and the subsequent RUN.
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

WORKDIR /telemetry/godev

COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Download the dependencies.
RUN go mod download

WORKDIR /telemetry

# Copy the repo from local machine into Docker clientâ€™s current working
# directory, so that we can use it to build the binary.
# See .dockerignore at the repo root for excluded files.
COPY . ./

WORKDIR /telemetry/godev

# Build the telemetrygodev binary and put it in /app.
RUN go build -mod=readonly -o /app/telemetrygodev ./cmd/telemetrygodev
